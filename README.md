# Smart_City_using_IOT

Smart cities are metropolitan areas that use advanced technology and data to enhance livability, service effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. In this context, the use of IoT can help in various aspects.

With the help of the Internet of Things, we created a working prototype of a smart city that included:

Smart car parking system: A smart parking system is an automated infrastructure that utilizes sensors, microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino Uno), and servo motors to monitor the occupancy of parking spaces. It provides real-time information to drivers and parking management personnel, enabling efficient utilization of parking resources and enhancing the overall parking experience.


Weather station: A Weather Station is a sophisticated meteorological instrument used for collecting real-time data on various atmospheric conditions. It plays a crucial role in providing accurate and timely weather information for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, aviation, research, and environmental monitoring. One of the key features of a weather station is its ability to measure multiple parameters simultaneously, including temperature, pressure, altitude, and humidity.

Automated street light system: Automatic street lights using LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) are a practical application of sensor-based automation technology. This system intelligently controls street lights by automatically turning them on when ambient light levels drop (e.g.: at dusk) and off when there's sufficient natural light (e.g.: at dawn).

Conclusion:

An Internet of Things (IoT)-powered Smart City that incorporates features like a weather station, parking system, home automation, and automatic street lighting represents a forward-thinking and sustainable urban future. 

• The Parking System reduces congestion, saves time, and lowers carbon emissions by guiding drivers to available parking spaces. 

• The Weather Station helps with the collection of real-time weather data, which is important for disaster preparedness and urban planning.
 
• Automatic street lighting reduces light pollution, improves safety, and optimizes energy consumption.

Together, these IoT-driven solutions create a harmonious, efficient, and environmentally conscious urban environment. Smart Cities pave the way for a brighter, more sustainable future.
